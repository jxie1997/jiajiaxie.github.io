I am a Ph.D student in the interdisciplinary Computational Science and Engineering program at Georgia Institute of Technology Tech [Georgia Tech](https://cse.gatech.edu/) where I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Cassie S. Mitchell](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Cassie-S.-Mitchell) from the [Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics](https://sites.gatech.edu/cassie-mitchell-lab/) in the Department of [Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/). Before then, I attained my Master of Science in the same major as well and fortunately being advised jointly by [Prof. B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/) and [Prof. Lauren N. Steimle](https://sites.gatech.edu/steimle/) studying WiFi networks and mobility data and Covid-19 models. I have interned at [Tesla](https://tesla.com/), working on the networking planning of supercharger networks, and [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), on large-scale representative themodynamic models, for the past few years.
Previously, I studied Economics and Mathematics and attained my BS.s from Presbyterian College, SC, United States. 

The kinetics behind a lot of social, physical, and pathologocial dynamics are nothing but networks (interactions) and perturbations (noise). These networks representing various connections can be online, sparse, or expensive to approximate and maintain. If we can simulate a process on these networks, can we reversely turn that model to complete the networks, reestabilish the progression, compress the models, or generate new data? To this end, these topics have been and will be continuously explored during my Ph.D.  



* **Network Diffusion Constrained Generative Models of Brain Connectomes**: Comming soon!

* **Source-robustly Reconstructing Epidemic from Temporal-network Diffusion under Online Noise**: Comming soon!

* **Physics-representative RC-network-based Themodynamic Models of Residenital Buildings**: ([Energy & Buildings 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778824005243))

Outside of the main stem, I also explored these topics:  

* **Augmenting Bayesian Topic Models using Online Confirmation from Community-driven Apps**: ([BuildSys 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3600100.3626341))

* **Empirical WiFi Datasets for Localizing Covid-19 Intervention**: ([Front. in Digital Health 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1060828/full))

Outside of research, I am a dreamer, a reader, and an audience of many musicals, sports, and concerts (ðŸ–¤ðŸ©·).
