I am a Ph.D student in the interdisciplinary Computational Science and Engineering program at [Georgia Tech](https://cse.gatech.edu/) where I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Cassie S. Mitchell](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Cassie-S.-Mitchell) from the [Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics](https://sites.gatech.edu/cassie-mitchell-lab/). Before then, I attained my M.S. in the same major advised jointly by [Prof. B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/) and [Prof. Lauren N. Steimle](https://sites.gatech.edu/steimle/) studying WiFi networks and mobility data and Covid-19 models. I interned at [Tesla](https://tesla.com/), on networking planning of superchargers, and [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), on large-scale representative themodynamic models.
Previously, I studied Economics and Mathematics and attained my BS.s from Presbyterian College, SC, United States. 

The kinetics behind a lot of social, physical, and pathologocial dynamics are nothing but networks (interactions) and perturbations (noise). These networks representing various connections can be online, sparse, or expensive to approximate and maintain. If one can model/simulate a real-world process on these networks, can we reversely turn that model to complete the networks, re-estabilish the progression, or generate new data? To this end, these topics have been and will be continuously explored during my Ph.D.

Off the main stem, I also explored these topics:  

* **Augmenting Bayesian Topic Models using Online Confirmation from Community-driven Apps**: ([BuildSys 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3600100.3626341))

* **Empirical WiFi Datasets for Localizing Covid-19 Intervention**: ([Front. in Digital Health 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1060828/full))

Outside of research, I am a dreamer, a reader, and an audience of musicals, sports, and concerts (ðŸ–¤ðŸ©·).
